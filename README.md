##Inspiration
We found the Kinect a fun and challenging opportunity to work with, while providing a wide range of possibilities.

##What it does
Controls the users mouse and some screen functions to browse windows and applications.

##How we built it
We used the Kinect SDK along with the supplied tutorials, and built upon these.

##Challenges we ran into
We had very little experience of C#, with most members never using it before - and the same with Visual Studio.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
It works.

##What we learned
Roughly how to use C# and the Kinect SDK..

##What's next for Morgan Stanley Challenge
Demonstration and presentation of the project.
